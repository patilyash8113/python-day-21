Day 16 of my Python journey

Today I learned about instances in class and inheritance

1) instance = Suppose we create a class called Employee and in that we create an attribute called "company=Asus". And for some time, we leave it as it is.

Now, in that class, I create a method that has information of employees like salary, name, bond, and also the company

Now whenever I print the company, it prints the method "company" instead of the class attribute "company". The method attributes are called "inheritance".



2) Inheritance: Inheritance is like a family tree. A child class inherits attributes and methods from the parent class. This allows you to create new classes that are specialize version of existing classes without rewriting the existing code...
